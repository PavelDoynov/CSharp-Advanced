 * 01. Key Revolver
 * 
 * Our favorite super-spy action hero Sam is back from his mission in another exam, and this time he has an even more
 * difficult task. He needs to unlock a safe. The problem is that the safe is locked by several locks in a row, which 
 * all have varying sizes.
 * 
 * Our hero posesses a special weapon though, called the Key Revolver, with special bullets. Each bullet can unlock a 
 * lock with a size equal to or smaller than the size of the bullet. The bullet goes into the keyhole, then explodes, 
 * completely destroying it. Sam doesn’t know the size of the locks, so he needs to just shoot at all of them, until the 
 * safe runs out of locks.
 * 
 * What’s behind the safe, you ask? Well, intelligence! It is told that Sam’s sworn enemy – Nikoladze, keeps his top 
 * secret Georgian Chacha Brandy recipe inside. It’s valued differently across different times of the year, so Sam’s boss
 * will tell him what it’s worth over the radio. One last thing, every bullet Sam fires will also cost him money, which 
 * will be deducted from his pay from the price of the intelligence. 
 * 
 * Good luck, operative.
 * 
 * Input
 * •   On the first line of input, you will receive the price of each bullet – an integer in the range [0-100]
 * •   On the second line, you will receive the size of the gun barrel – an integer in the range [1-5000]
 * •   On the third line, you will receive the bullets – a space-separated integer sequence with [1-100] integers
 * •   On the fourth line, you will receive the locks – a space-separated integer sequence with [1-100] integers
 * •   On the fifth line, you will receive the value of the intelligence – an integer in the range [1-100000]
 * 
 * After Sam receives all of his information and gear (input), he starts to shoot the locks front-to-back, while going
 * through the bullets back-to-front.
 * If the bullet has a smaller or equal size to the current lock, print “Bang!”, then remove the lock. 
 * If not, print “Ping!”, leaving the lock intact. The bullet is removed in both cases.
 * 
 * If Sam runs out of bullets in his barrel, print “Reloading!” on the console, then continue shooting. 
 * If there aren’t any bullets left, don’t print it.
 * 
 * The program ends when Sam either runs out of bullets, or the safe runs out of locks.
 * 
 * Output
 * •    If Sam runs out of bullets before the safe runs out of locks, print:
 * “Couldn't get through. Locks left: {locksLeft}”
 * •   If Sam manages to open the safe, print:
 * “{bulletsLeft} bullets left. Earned ${moneyEarned}”
 * Make sure to account for the price of the bullets when calculating the money earned.
 * 
 * Constraints
 * •   The input will be within the constaints specified above and will always be valid. There is no need to check it 
 * explicitly.
 * •   There will never be a case where Sam breaks the lock and ends up with negative balance.
 * 
 * Example
