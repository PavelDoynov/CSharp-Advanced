 * 10. The Heigan Dance
 * 
 * At last, level 80. And what do level eighties do? Go raiding. This is where you are now – trying not to be wiped by
 * the famous dance boss, Heigan the Unclean. The fight is pretty straightforward - dance around the Plague Clouds and
 * Eruptions, and you’ll be just fine.
 * 
 * Heigan’s chamber is a 15-by-15 two-dimensional array. The player always starts at the exact center. 
 * For each turn, Heigan uses a spell that hits a certain cell and the neighboring rows/columns. 
 * For example, if he hits (1,1), he also hits (0,0, 0,1, 0,2, 1,0 … 2,2). If the player’s current position is within 
 * the area of damage, the player tries to move. First, he tries to move up, if there’s damage/wall, he tries to move right,
 * then down, then left. If he cannot move in any direction, because the cell is damaged or there is a wall, 
 * the player stays in place and takes the damage.
 * 
 * Plague cloud does 3500 damage when it hits, and 3500 damage the next turn. Then it expires. 
 * Eruption does 6000 damage when it hits. If a spell hits a player that also has an active Plague Cloud from the
 * previous turn, the cloud damage is applied first. 
 * Both Heigan and the player may die in the same turn. If Heigan is dead, the spell he would have casted is ignored.
 * 
 * The player always starts at 18500 hit points; Heigan starts at 3,000,000 hit points. Each turn, the player does damage 
 * to Heigan. The fight is over either when the player is killed, or Heigan is defeated.
 * 
 * Input
 * •   On the first line you receive a floating-point number D – the damage done to Heigan each turn
 * •   On the next several lines – you receive input in format {spell} {row} {col} – {spell} is either Cloud or Eruption
 * 
 * Output
 * •       On the first line  
 *   o   If Heigan is defeated: “Heigan: Defeated!”
 *   o   Else: “Heigan: {remaining}”, where remaining is rounded to two digits after the decimal separator
 * •       On the second line:
 *   o   If the player is killed: “Player: Killed by {spell}”
 *   o   Else “Player: {remaining}”
 * •       On the third line: “Final position: {row,  col}” -> the last coordinates of the player
 * 
 * Constraints
 * •   D is a floating-point number in range [0 … 500000]
 * •   A damaging spell will always affect at least one cell
 * •   Allowed memory: 16 MB
 * •   Allowed working time: 0.25s
 *
